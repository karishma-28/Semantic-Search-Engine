# Semantic Search Engine Application using FastAPI, Pinecone, and Sentence Transformers  

This is a semantic search application (similar to Quora) built using FastAPI, Pinecone, and Sentence Transformers. The application allows users to input text, which is then processed and queried against a Pinecone vector database to find the most relevant matches of questions from quora.

## Features
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+.
- **Pinecone**: A vector database for machine learning applications. It is used to store and query high-dimensional vectors.
- **Sentence Transformers**: A library for sentence embeddings using transformer models.

#### Endpoints
- **Get /**: Returns the homepage.

- **Post /process**: Returns the search results

### Pinecone usage
 The application uses Pinecone to store and query vectors. The Pinecone API key is stored in the `.env` file.
- The application creates a Pinecone index with the name `quora-index`.
- The vectors are stored in the Pinecone index using the `upsert` method.
- The vectors are queried using the `query` method.
### Sentence-Transformers usage
The application uses Sentence Transformers to encode the input text and the stored vectors. The Sentence Transformers model is loaded using the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.
